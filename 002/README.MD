#Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibbonacci sequence is generated by adding the previos two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    > 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89

By considderring the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
