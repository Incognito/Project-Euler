#Problem 2

Each new term in the Fibbonacci sequence is generated by adding the previos two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    > 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89

By considderring the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

#Notes

There should be a way to estimate via phi and taylor series... I think/hope?

The brute force recursive fib() function I'm using in alpha is going to be slow...

I think there's a nPc calculation I can make to estimate the size of a series with a max term... I have to think back to pascal triangles etc...
