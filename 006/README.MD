The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is...

    1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + ... 10^2  = 385

The square sum of the first ten natural numbers is...

    (1 + 2 + 3 + ... 10)^2 = 3025
    
Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025-385 = 2640

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
